# Zork Game

This is a text adventure game, similar to the choose your own adventure Zork books. The user can input actions and directions to take decisions.
The story takes place on a ship, where the main hero must escape.  

We utilized an Asciify.py file cloned from this repository (https://github.com/RameshAditya/asciify). It utilizes the PIL library to read an image
and provide the ASCII representation which is then printed to the console. We made necessary edits to asciify.py to better customize output.

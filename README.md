# Zork Game

![](https://github.com/LeTruongCSUMB/Project_Zork/blob/setsuka/images/Untitled.png)

This is a text adventure game, similar to the choose your own adventure Zork books. The user can input actions and directions to take decisions.
The story takes place on a ship, where the main hero must escape.  

We utilized an Asciify.py file cloned from this repository (https://github.com/RameshAditya/asciify). It utilizes the PIL library to read an image
and provide the ASCII representation which is then printed to the console. We made necessary edits to asciify.py to better customize output.

## Getting Started

Download main.py, asciify.py, and the images/ folder.

### Prerequisites

PIL is a dependency


### Installing

First clone the repo
